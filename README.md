# Description

# Assumptions

1. Since in seek, newfolder as target prints newfolder.txt ,ive assumed that the target word must be a prefix of the actual file.

2. seek cannot see hidden files.

3. If the total time taken by all the processes in a single line of commands is greater than 2, then im printing the whole commmand line in the next prompt.
